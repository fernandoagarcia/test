        <h4>DICTATORS ARE NOT PUNISHED FOR THEIR SINS, BUT BY THEM – THEY DON’T ALLOW FOR ‘DO-OVERS’</h4>
        <p>Autocracy is a high beta solution. It can turn out very good, as it did in Singapore’s case, or it can turn out very badly.</p>
        <p>It turns out badly 99% of the time, measured both by the rights of people in those countries and their economies.</p>
        <p>That’s math, not hyperbole. If autocracy were a formula for success, African nations would be rich.</p>
        <p>Countries that trade freedom for prosperity are going to regret it most of the time, and likely for a long time. Unlike democracies, dictatorships don’t allow for ‘do-overs’.</p>
        <p>This Sino-centrist worldview has in many ways shaped China’s outlook on global governance; the rules, norms, and institutions that regulate international cooperation.</p>
        <p>In the past two decades, China has reemerged as a major power, with the world’s second largest economy and a world-class military. It increasingly asserts itself, seeking to regain its centrality in the international system and over global governance institutions.</p>
        <p>China’s President, “Big Ming” Zhang, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has called for China to “lead the reform of the global governance system,” transforming institutions and norms in ways that will reflect Beijing’s values and priorities.</p>
        <p>But China is inherently unstable because all that holds it together is an imperial culture and the tax collector in Beijing. It’s just like a collection of very powerful, oppositely charged magnets held together by super glue. It looks stable, but it really isn’t.   And when the money starts drying up, so does “Big Ming” patronages and his military allegiances.</p>
        <p>It’s 2024, and slowly but surely, the Chinese economy is imploding. The implosion of its economy can be directly attributed to devastating economic decisions made by “Big Ming” Zhang, the current Chinese president for life. But the ramifications of this change go beyond an implosion in one sector of the economy. The world is watching sacred cows being slaughtered there. </p>
        <p>That raging discontent is not what was promised billions of Chinese people!  Especially after a 3-year COVID lockdown where untold millions died, and small business went bankrupt.</p>
        <p>The Chinese people are extremely unhappy. </p>
        <p>And more importantly, so are “Big Ming’s” most dangerous enemies, the CCP Party elite, and the Triads, especially the largest and most powerful Triad, Sun Yee On, and the unnamed "Dragon Head" of Kong Sun Yee On, both of whom were listed on Asiaweek's list of the 50 most powerful people in Asia, and who have protected “Big Ming’s” private multi-million dollar illicit business interests, including the production of drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl, in the country’s chemical and pharmaceutical industries, which remain firmly in the hands of Chinese organized crime syndicates.</p>
        <p>These criminal groups provide a variety of services to the CCP’s legal businesses, including to firms with ties to government officials and the Chinese Communist Party. Efforts to better regulate precursor chemicals and fentanyl analogs are also hampered by systemic corruption and the incentive structures within which Chinese officials operate.</p>
        <p>“Big Ming” and his “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy reflects its intentional destabilizing behavior as its military, economic and diplomatic power increase, not only in its backyard of East and South Asia, but across the Indian Ocean to east Africa and down into the South Pacific.</p>
        <p>“Big Ming” publicly proclaims he’s ‘righting history’ for China, by making extensive maritime claims throughout the South and East China seas and enforcing those claims by constructing military bases on  Woody Island in the Paracels and on all seven of the Spratly Islands that it occupies.</p>
        <p>But the real reason for behind this ‘righting the wrongs perpetrated against China by foreign powers demonstrates the criminal relationship between “Big Ming’s” Chinese Communist Party and Chinese organized crime figures, particularly, a senior triad member, Wan Kuok Koi, also known as Broken Tooth, and are operating illegal online gambling operations, and blockchain based insurance schemes to real-world casinos, with the complete knowledge of the Chinese state.</p>
        <p>“Big Ming’ and his criminal Triad counterparts are moving into countries with weak governance to build illicit business empires and launder money, often through businesses similar to those popping up in Palau, like casinos and cryptocurrency schemes, he said. By offshoring their criminal activities, they avoid Beijing’s ire and show their usefulness to the CCP through corrupting local elites. Their goal is to build “vast networks both with Chinese business actors and elites across the region, co-opting them into its various schemes.”</p>
        <p>But “Big Ming” ego over the last 14 years in office, has rocked the boat too much, and is now jeopardizing the CCP’s and the Triad’s immense criminal financial empires, as well as the military wrath of the United States and the West.</p>
        <p>These groups oppose “Big Ming’s” betrayal of Deng’s reformist line, to which they intend to return at all cost, as well as advocate reconciliation with the United States and the West.</p>
        <p>The daggers have already come out inside the party first. “Big Ming” has always understood that his chief political opposition was inside the elite alliance, of which he is a member and have benefited most from the fat years, supported and enforced behind the scenes by the Triad Crime Lords and their criminal syndicates.</p>
        <p>When an entrenched autocratic regime violates the “NO POLITICS, NO PROBLEM” deal, the economic ramifications are pervasive, and deadly. </p>
        <p>Once an autocratic regime has lost the confidence of the average household and business, it is difficult to win back.</p>
        <p>Miracles last only so long. And because current Chinese ‘Miracle Man, Big Ming’, can no longer to deliver ‘the Chinese economic miracle’ to the masses, and protect the CCP’s and the Triads billion-dollar empires, an imminent revolution is brewing.   </p>
        <p>“Big Ming” is backed into a corner and to preserve his absolute power, he’s taking a page out of the “Dictators Playbook” used by Benito Mussolini, Idi Amin to Manuel Noriega to Saddam Hussein, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jung Un, and now “Big Ming” Zhang. But since they were always  plagued by secret fears and private demons, they started wars against enemies, real and imagined, so they can crack down on political opposition and remain in power if the fight goes badly.  Just like “Big Ming” intends to do.</p>
        <p>“Big Ming” doesn’t Trust His Own Military and all dictatorships that fail to repress the opposition are susceptible to collapse through a coup or a revolution.</p>
        <p>And that’s exactly why General Chun Wang, the Vice Chairman of the chief of the Chinese Central Military Commission (CMC) and the PLA Joint Staff Department at the command center for the military, second in command to “Big Ming” in the CCP,  and some of his recently fired senior Chinese Generals on the “Rocket Force”, including the defense minister and the leadership of the force responsible for China’s intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), contacted General Robert G. Lundy, The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) Director to assist them in overturning “Big Ming’s” government, before he unleashes China’s arsenal of roughly 500 warheads, and sophisticated array of nuclear armed missiles, submarines, bombers and hypersonic vehicles, against the US and it allies, and to American military bases on, say, Japan or Guam. The risk of a conventional clash spiraling into nuclear confrontation perilously hangs over the entire world.</p>
        <p>China is not only on a quest for more warheads, but it’s also focused on concealing and shielding the warheads, and on being able to launch them more quickly and from land, sea, or air. Its Rocket Force has added a powerful voice to that effort. China has also added more road- and rail-mobile missile launchers to try to outfox American satellites and other detection technology. </p>
        <p>Lundy has dispatched NCTC Undercover Agent Colonel Tommy Schmid and his Special Ops teams to coordinate US military expertise to assist General Wang, and not only stop “Big Ming’s ethnic genocide against China’s 12 million Uyghurs, but also to assist them ‘behind the scenes’ in a clandestine military coup d’etat to overthrow ‘Big Ming’s’ government before it’s too late.</p>
        <p>With Schmid’s trademark deep investigative Special Forces and National Counterterrorism (NCTC) experience, he and his Special Ops teams work undercover with the Triads, as deep as one can go into these clandestine “Secret Black Societies”, to stop “Big Ming” from starting World War III.</p>
        <p>But who will be ‘Checkmated’ in this deadly potential nuclear confrontation? Schmid, Wang, and “Big Ming” are all experts at the intellectually challenging games, “Chess” and “Go”. They know that military strategies parallel these games moves, especially the deep penetration raid’ – a particular outcome from chess theory, which saw the spectacular instances of success, as well as failures, include the US Navy Seals raid into Abbottabad (2011), the earlier Israeli hostage release at Entebbe (1976) and the extraction of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann from Argentina (1960). Equally, the disasters – the botched US hostage rescue from Teheran (1980) and the infamous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba (1960).</p>
        <p>Intercepted encrypted communications from “Big Ming’s” secret war cabinet prove that Schmid, Wang, and the Triads, have only got 7 days to save the world from “Big Ming” starting WWIII against his perceived and imagined enemies, 6 days to save the hundreds of Millions of Chinese who just want to live peacefully in the most terrifying time-bomb of a crisis in modern times.</p>
        <p>All of this seems unimaginable. </p>
        <p>Yet so often our challenges in responding to the greatest threats are not failures of intelligence, but rather failures of imagination. No one ever imagined Pearl Harbor; or a devastating attack on the U.S. that destroyed the World Trade Towers; or a twenty-year war in Afghanistan; or a global pandemic. Collectively we have to imagine the disaster of a possible war between the U.S. and China, so we can reverse engineer and prevent it.</p>
        <p>They say, “The Road to Hell is lined with Good Intentions”, but the unexpected deadly wrinkles, surprises, compromised Agents and betrayals, in both Schmid and General Wang’s plans, as well as the Triads, set in a world of corrupt Generals, shady Politicians, gangsters, prostitutes, bootleggers, opium addicts, jazz musicians, drug lords, and your run of the mill criminals, murderers, thieves, and con artists make this mission the most dangerous and deadly in mankind’s history.</p>

      <p>The term "Karma" is often used with great casualness, with little understanding of its profundity. People dismissively say "it's my Karma," suggesting that their destiny or fate is merely the luck or bad fortune of the draw. This use of the term suggests a lack of personal power or responsibility for being at both the cause and the effect of what occurs in one's life. Using the phrase "it's my Karma" suggests victimhood, and Karma is anything but victimhood.This deeper understanding of Karma rests upon our essential identity as souls -- spiritual beings who are animated by a vital and divine force. As souls we are spiritually held accountable for what we create, promote, and allow in our lives. We are constantly in the process of accruing and/or balancing out karmic debts of responsibility for our creations.Karma is not about retribution, vengeance, punishment or reward, but a reaping of the harvest we ourselves have planted. Through our thoughts and behaviors, we sow seeds that are later harvested.The “Karma Justice – The New Law & Order” Book Series is based on the premise that Men are not punished for their sins, but by them. Thoughts lead on to purposes; purposes go forth in action; actions form habits; habits decide character; and character fixes our destiny. We. writers, directors, Network TV and Documentary film producers are the “unacknowledged legislators of the world”. To say that the pen is mightier than the sword is to trivialize the pen. The pen is far mightier than a sword; it’s mightier than a nuclear bomb. Mightier than all the nuclear bombs ever created. With our pens, we write and record stories of Karma daily. Also remember that knowledge is power and the more our electorate understands the true miraculous benefits of all the issues, and our American legislative process, the more they can influence legislators to do the right thing for all Americans, not just the rich and powerful. Documentary film producers and investigative journalists are called to keep digging until we find the truth…And then proclaim and expose it.</p>
